        <h2>Community Leadership Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="philosophy-content">
            <p>My approach to community involvement stems from the same principles that guide my professional leadership: <strong>empowering others through technology and education</strong>. Just as I believe in mentoring technical talent in corporate environments, I'm committed to creating opportunities for underserved communities to access and benefit from technology.</p>
            
            <p>The Village Scribe Association represents the intersection of my technical expertise and social responsibility. By establishing programs in both developed and developing regions, we create sustainable models for technology education that can be replicated and scaled.</p>
